### *AI-Powered Multi-Persona Decision Support System*

---

## üìò Overview

The **Personal Board of Directors (PBoD)** is an interactive AI-driven decision support framework designed to simulate the experience of consulting a diverse panel of experts, leaders, and thinkers ‚Äî each powered by its own **distinct persona**.

Built entirely in **Python**, PBoD uses modular architecture, YAML persona profiles, and OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models to create realistic advisory discussions on complex topics ranging from business strategy to personal growth.

Each persona represents a unique worldview, reasoning style, and domain of expertise ‚Äî allowing users to experience well-rounded, multi-perspective decision-making in real time.

---

## üéØ Purpose

Originally developed as a **portfolio project** for the Post Graduate Program in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (PGP-AIML)** at **The University of Texas at Austin**, PBoD now stands as a demonstration of:

- **Applied LLM reasoning** using structured, context-aware prompts.  
- **System design for explainable AI collaboration.**  
- **Human-AI augmentation in leadership, governance, and education.**

Beyond its academic foundation, PBoD offers potential **enterprise applications** in IT governance, change management, vendor risk assessment, and GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance).

## üöÄ Features

### üîπ Modular Design
Each component serves a specific function, ensuring flexibility and clarity:
- **`persona_loader.py`** ‚Äì Loads and validates persona YAML files.  
- **`prompt_composer.py`** ‚Äì Constructs structured prompts per persona.  
- **`board_chat.py`** ‚Äì Manages concurrent persona responses and board logic.  
- **`session_logger.py`** ‚Äì Saves meeting results in Markdown and JSON format.  
- **`pbo_cli.py`** ‚Äì The interactive command-line interface that drives it all.  

### üîπ Dynamic Persona Engine
- Personas are defined via YAML (e.g., `v_SunTzu.yaml`, `v_Oprah.yaml`, etc.).  
- Each persona includes fields like `name`, `domain`, `temperature`, and `anchor_quote`.  
- Easily add new personas or modify existing ones without touching any core code.  

### üîπ Interactive CLI
- Select personas by number or use the default board.  
- Reuse previous session boards.  
- Ask new questions, reuse old questions, or start over entirely.  
- Exit with or without saving reports.  

### üîπ Rich Output & Reports
- Colorized console display for clarity and readability.  
- Session logs automatically saved as:
  - **Markdown Reports** (for human reading)
  - **JSON Records** (for data analytics or dashboards)
- Optional index tracking for previous sessions.  

### üîπ Configurable via YAML
- A `pbo_config.yaml` allows you to define:
  - Default model (e.g., `gpt-5`, `gpt-4o-mini`)
  - Auto-save behavior  
  - Directory paths for logs and sessions  

### üîπ Example Default Board
| Persona ID | Real Name | Short Description |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| v_Buddha | Siddhartha Gautama | Mindfulness, detachment, and reflective clarity. |
| v_Indra | Indra Nooyi | Purpose-driven leadership and empathy. |

## üß† Enterprise Use Cases

While PBoD began as an academic and creative exploration, it has clear business potential across **IT and GRC workflows**:

| Function | Virtual Board Type | Value Delivered |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| IT Operations | Change Advisory Board | Faster, consistent, risk-aware approvals |

## üìä Learnings & Insights

Developing PBoD involved deep exploration across **AI design, governance modeling, and prompt engineering**:

- **LLM Behavior Control:** Tuning persona ‚Äútemperature‚Äù values changes reasoning style, tone, and creativity ‚Äî critical for realistic advisory dialogue.  
- **Structured Context Delivery:** YAML persona files and prompt templates enforce consistent, deterministic output.  
- **Human-Centric Design:** The project illustrates how AI can *amplify* human reflection, not replace it.  
- **Explainability Through Dialogue:** Simulated discussions naturally expose reasoning logic ‚Äî a key goal in enterprise AI adoption.  
- **Scalability Potential:** Modular structure makes it adaptable to enterprise GRC systems, ITSM platforms (e.g., ServiceNow), or even change management frameworks.

## üß© Future Enhancements

- Integration with **Streamlit or NiceGUI** for a web-based dashboard.  
- Persona clustering (e.g., ‚ÄúInnovators‚Äù, ‚ÄúEthicists‚Äù, ‚ÄúStrategists‚Äù) for themed consultations.  
- Weighted consensus scoring between personas.  
- Real-time keyword and sentiment extraction for board discussions.  
- Integration with enterprise APIs (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira, or Power BI dashboards).
